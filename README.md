# Independent Projects  

Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models to Predict Stroke Risk                                                        

Designed a classification problem in collaboration with a 2-person student team and domain experts at the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI), VUMC
Utilized and evaluated innovative machine learning algorithms from decision trees to neural networks in Python to classify outcomes and compare algorithm performance with traditional stroke risk prediction models; most balanced model produced an accuracy of 72.4% and a false negative rate of 59.0%
Analyzed technical problems surrounding algorithms to troubleshoot major technical issues and optimize machine learning models while testing the best hyperparameters
Type II Diabetes Prediction Database                                                                                

Communicated with technical and non-technical stakeholders to meet the functional specifications
Designed database in SQLite intended to allow patients and health providers to track the risk factors associated with type 2 diabetes
Programmed database to include patient lifestyle choices and provider visit information as per functional specifications
Data Mining Project
