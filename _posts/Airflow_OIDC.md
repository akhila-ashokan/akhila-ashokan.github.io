Airflow comes with many authentication options. I thought I would document the steps I took to configure a custom provider, Keycloak, for Airflow authentication. 
This tutorial assumes you have Airflow configured on your system and know client credentials for Keycloak authentication. 
Set rbac = True in Airflow's config file (airflow.cfg)

This will be enable the Flask-Appbuilder UI (FAB) that Airflow uses for role-based access control (rbac) features. 
Restart the webserver through the CLI

`airflow webserver`


This should create the `webserver_config.py` file in the Airflow home directory.

Install [flask-oidc](https://flask-oidc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package in your virtual environment where Airflow is installed

`pip3 install flask-oidc`

Clone the [fab_oidc](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/fab-oidc) repo from Github in  the airflow home directory
Create `client-configuration.json` file with the following credential information and add to airflow home directory:

```
{
    "web": {
        "client_id": "WHATEVER_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_IS",
        "client_secret": "WHATEVER_YOUR_SECRET_IS",
        "auth_uri": "https://<domain>/auth/realms/myrealm/protocol/openid-connect/auth",
        "token_uri": "https://<domain>/auth/realms/myrealm/protocol/openid-connect/token",
        "userinfo_uri": "https://<domain>/auth/realms/myrealm/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo",
        "issuer": "https://<domain>/auth/myrealm/client_id",
        "redirect_uris": [
            "http://localhost:8080/oidc_callback"
        ]
    }
}
```

Modify `webserver_config.py` file with the following details

```
from flask_appbuilder.security.manager import AUTH_OID
import sys
sys.path.append('/absolute_path_to/airflow_home')
from fab_oidc.security import AirflowOIDCSecurityManager
AUTH_TYPE = AUTH_OID 
# Uncomment to setup Full admin role name 
# AUTH_ROLE_ADMIN = 'Admin'  
# Uncomment to setup Public role name, no authentication needed 
# AUTH_ROLE_PUBLIC = 'Public'  
# Will allow user self registration 
AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION = False  
# The default user self registration role 
AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION_ROLE = "Admin"  
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRETS = 'absolute_path_to/client-configuration.json' 
OIDC_VALID_ISSUERS = 'https://<domain>/auth/realms/myrealm' # can be found as iss in jwt access token
SECURITY_MANAGER_CLASS = AirflowOIDCSecurityManager 
OIDC_USER_INFO_ENABLED = True OIDC_SCOPES = ['openid', 'email', 'profile'] # verify with scope in jwt access token
OIDC_CLOCK_SKEW: 560 
OIDC_RESOURCE_CHECK_AUD: True 
OIDC_INTROSPECTION_AUTH_METHOD: 'client_secret_post' # verify with jwt access token 
OIDC_ID_TOKEN_COOKIE_SECURE = False # should be set to True in production environment
```

Set env variables in shell where program is running-change based on your specifications 
```
export USERNAME_OIDC_FIELD='preferred_username'
export FIRST_NAME_OIDC_FIELD='given_name'
export LAST_NAME_OIDC_FIELD='family_name'
```

Restart airflow webserver

Through the Airflow CLI, create an admin user that has the same credentials (username, first name, last name, email) as your user on keycloak 
Visit the Airflow UI. You should now be redirected to the Keycloak login page.
